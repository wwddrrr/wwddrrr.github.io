**Machine Learning and Hyperdimensional Computing**

<span style="color:lightgray; font-size: smaller;">Python, R    Collaborated with Yinan Bu</span>

- Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is an effcient, interpretable, and robust computing method based on calculation of hyper vectors.
- Applied this method to the data in UKbiobank and designed several models for data processing and embedding.
- Trained the HDC model and predicted the prevalence rate of several illnesses.

**Reinforcement Learning AI for GuanDan (a Chinese card game)**

<span style="color:lightgray; font-size: smaller;">Python    Collaborated with Xiaopu Wang</span>

- This project aims to train a reinforcement learning AI capable of playing GuanDan. One of the key challenges in training such an AI arises from the presence of wildcard cards, which significantly expand the action space. This complexity makes it difficult to effectively train a Q-network.
- Trained a Q-network to evaluate the value of different card-playing choices.
- Developed a transformer-based model for hand card planning and decomposition in Guandan to narrow the action selection space and make choices within a more optimal range.
- Retrain the Q-network with improved choices derived from the card decomposition model.
